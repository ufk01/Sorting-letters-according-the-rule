# Sorting-letters-according-the-rule
Personal Code:I tried to print the first letters of each element (from the beginning to the end) in the imported string array, followed by the second, third... letters in order. In the meantime, I did it by considering the length of the element inside each array. For example, the first element is all printed, but if the second element still has an element to be printed, I continued from the second element.
For example: String [] arr ={"Daisy","Alex","Welcome","James"};
output: DAWJaleaielmsxceyosme
